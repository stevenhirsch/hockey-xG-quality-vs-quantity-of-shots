# Hockey xG Quality versus Quantity of Shots Analysis

A pertinent tactical question in territory sports is whether a higher amount of low-quality shots at goal versus a lower amount of high-quality shots at goal results in different probabilities of winning a match. Others have already reported that teams with a lower amount of high-quality shots are more likely to win soccer matches than teams with a higher amount of low-quality shots. However, the points awarded for winning and losing are allocated differently in soccer versus hockey. Therefore, the results from soccer can't be extrapolated directly to ice hockey.

The purpose of this analysis was to assess whether a lower amount of high-quality shots results in higher xPTS relative to a higher amount of low-quality shots in ice hockey. I hypothesized that a lower amount of high-quality shots would accumulate more xPTS than a higher amount of low-quality shots due to the xPTS findings from soccer. Further supporting this hypothesis is the current trend in basketball to prioritize shooting three-point shots to improve the probability of winning.

In this stochastic simulation analysis (located in the Colab notebook), Team A accumulated 33% fewer shots than Team B in each game, but both teams accumulated the same total xG. I simulated 1,000 potential games, each with varying xG accumulation ranging from 1.0 to 7.0. I simulated each game 10,000 times for a total of 10 million simulations. A problem I ran into with point allocation was when a game was tied after regulation and went into overtime. I modelled the 3-on-3 overtime (and shootout) as a coin flip (i.e., 50%). I decided to model it this way because I didn't think it was fair to assume, based on the xG accumulated in regulation time, which team is more likely to win.

The findings supported my hypothesis that teams are projected to win more points if they generate a lower quantity of high-quality shots relative to their opponent (assuming the same total xG). This finding has exciting applications for team building, tactics, and general hockey strategy (e.g., perhaps we want to "overload" talent onto one line to prioritize high-quality chances). However, there are limitations to consider of this work when applying it to practice. For example, it might be easier to defend against teams that are explicitly waiting to generate high-quality chances and not take opportunities for lower-quality shots. This is a common and valid criticism of xG models in general and likely require a more game-theoretic analysis to better understand how these findings should influence team tactics. Answering these future questions requires communication with domain-specific experts and perhaps more "real world" data.
